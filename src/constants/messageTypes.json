It also contains the Empty type, which is useful for sending an empty signal. However, these types do not convey semantic meaning about their contents: every message simply has a field called \"data\". Therefore, while the messages in this package can be useful for quick prototyping, they are NOT intended for \"long-term\" usage.

However, the same caveat as above applies: it's usually \"better\" (in the sense of making the code easier to understand, etc.) when developers use or create non-generic message types (see discussion in this thread for more detail).\n\n* [ByteMultiArray](msg/ByteMultiArray.msg)\n* [Float32MultiArray](msg/Float32MultiArray.msg)\n* [Float64MultiArray](msg/Float64MultiArray.msg)\n* [Int8MultiArray](msg/Int8MultiArray.msg)\n* [Int16MultiArray](msg/Int16MultiArray.msg)\n* [Int32MultiArray](msg/Int32MultiArray.msg)\n* [Int64MultiArray](msg/Int64MultiArray.msg)\n* [MultiArrayDimension](msg/MultiArrayDimension.msg)\n* [MultiArrayLayout](msg/MultiArrayLayout.msg)\n* [UInt16MultiArray](msg/UInt16MultiArray.msg)\n* [UInt32MultiArray](msg/UInt32MultiArray.msg)\n* [UInt64MultiArray](msg/UInt64MultiArray.msg)\n* [UInt8MultiArray](msg/UInt8MultiArray.msg)\n\n## Quality Declaration\nThis package claims to be in the **Quality Level 1** category, see the [Quality Declaration](QUALITY_DECLARATION.md) for more details.\n", "children": [{"value": "Bool.msg", "label": "Bool.msg", "description": "# This was originally provided as an example message.\n# It is deprecated as of Foxy\n# It is recommended to create your own semantically meaningful message.\n# However if you would like to continue using this please use the equivalent in example_msgs.\n\nbool data\n"}, {"value": "Byte.msg", "label": "Byte.msg", "description": "# This was originally provided as an example message.\n# It is deprecated as of Foxy\n# It is recommended to create your own semantically meaningful message.\n# However if you would like to continue using this please use the equivalent in example_msgs.\n\nbyte data\n"}, {"value": "ByteMultiArray.msg", "label": "ByteMultiArray.msg", "description": "# This was originally provided as an example message.\n# It is deprecated as of Foxy\n# It is recommended to create your own semantically meaningful message.\n# However if you would like to continue using this please use the equivalent in example_msgs.\n\n# Please look at the MultiArrayLayout message definition for\n# documentation on all multiarrays.\n\nMultiArrayLayout  layout        #
